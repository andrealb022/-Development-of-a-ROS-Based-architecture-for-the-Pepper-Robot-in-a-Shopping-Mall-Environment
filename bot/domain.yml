  utter_contest_info:
  - text: The Artificial Vision Contest 2025 is super exciting! It's all about detecting people, tracking them, figuring out their attributes (like gender, if they have a bag or a hat), and analyzing their behavior as they move through virtual lines. Teams upload their software, analyze a video recorded live, and produce results in real time. The coolest part? Pepper, the robot referee, summarizes everything and even compares results with the ground truth!
  - text: "Ah, the Artificial Vision Contest 2025! Imagine this: a live video, people walking around, and your software doing all the magic—detecting, tracking, and analyzing everything from gender to hats and bags. Plus, you'll track their paths across virtual lines! Results are shown live on a screen, and Pepper, our friendly robot, evaluates the scores. Fun, right? "
  - text: The Artificial Vision Contest is all about showcasing your skills in detection, tracking, and behavior analysis!
